    {
        que: "How can you use the INDEX and MATCH functions together to look up a value in Excel?",
        ans: "The INDEX and MATCH functions can be combined to perform a lookup. MATCH finds the position of a value in a column, and INDEX uses that position to return the value from a specified column. This combination is more versatile than VLOOKUP as it allows for lookup in any direction (left or right)."
      },
      {
        que: "What is the difference between a PivotTable and a regular table in Excel?",
        ans: "A PivotTable is a powerful tool used to summarize, analyze, explore, and present large amounts of data.
