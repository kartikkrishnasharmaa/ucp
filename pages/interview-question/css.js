    },

    {
      que: "Explain the 'box model' in CSS.",

    },

    {
      que: "What is the difference between inline and block elements?",

    },

    {
      que: "What is the CSS 'float' property used for?",
      ans: "The 'float' property is used to specify whether an element should float to the left, right, or none. It's commonly used for creating layouts where elements can be positioned side by side.",

    },

    {
      que: "Explain the difference between 'em' and 'rem' units in CSS.",
      ans: "'em' units are relative to the font size of the parent element, while 'rem' units are relative to the font size of the root element (usually the <html> element). 'rem' units provide a more predictable and consistent way to size elements.",
    },
    {
      que: "What is the CSS specificity and how does it work?",
      ans: "CSS specificity determines which style rules are applied to an element when multiple conflicting rules exist. It is calculated based on the selector's type, class, ID, and inline styles, with more specific selectors overriding less specific ones.",

      que: "How can you vertically center an element in CSS?",

    },

    {
      que: "What is the 'box-sizing' property in CSS?",
      ans: "The 'box-sizing' property controls how the width and height of an element are calculated. The default value is 'content-box', where the width and height only include the content. Setting it to 'border-box' includes the padding and border in the element's total size.",
    },

    {
      que: "What is the difference between 'display: none' and 'visibility: hidden'?",

    },

    {
      que: "How do you create a responsive website in CSS?",
      ans: "You can create a responsive website by using media queries to apply different styles based on the viewport size, employing fluid layouts with percentages or viewport units, and optimizing images and other media for various devices.",
    },

    {
      que: "What are CSS pseudo-elements?",
      ans: "CSS pseudo-elements are keywords that allow you to style certain parts of an element, such as ::before and ::after, which insert content before and after the element's content, respectively. They are used to add decorative elements or generate content dynamically.",
    },

    {
      que: "Explain the 'z-index' property in CSS.",
      ans: "The 'z-index' property controls the stacking order of positioned elements along the z-axis. Elements with a higher 'z-index' value appear above elements with a lower value. It only applies to positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed).",
    },

    {
      que: "What is the CSS 'transition' property used for?",

    },

    {
      que: "How can you include CSS in your HTML document?",
      ans: "You can include CSS in your HTML document using the <link> element to link an external CSS file, or by using the <style> element to embed CSS directly within the HTML document. Additionally, you can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements using the 'style' attribute.",
    },

    {
      que: "What is the difference between 'normalize.css' and 'reset.css'?",
      ans: "'normalize.css' is a CSS file that aims to make the default styles consistent across different browsers, providing a baseline for styling, while 'reset.css' aims to reset all styles to a consistent baseline, removing default browser styling completely.",

    },

    {
      que: "Explain the difference between 'inline-block' and 'inline' display properties in CSS.",
      ans: "'inline-block' elements are displayed as inline elements but behave like block-level elements, allowing you to set a width, height, margins, and padding. 'inline' elements, on the other hand, only take up as much width as necessary and do not allow setting a width or height.",
    },

    {
      que: "What is the 'currentColor' keyword in CSS?",
      ans: "The 'currentColor' keyword in CSS is used to refer to the computed value of the 'color' property. It allows for dynamic styling, where an element's border, background, or other properties can automatically inherit the current text color.",
    },

    {
      que: "How do you create a diagonal gradient background in CSS?",
      ans: "You can create a diagonal gradient background in CSS by using the 'linear-gradient' function and specifying the angle of the gradient. By setting the background to a linear gradient with appropriate color stops, you can achieve a diagonal gradient effect.",
    },

    {
      que: "What are vendor prefixes in CSS and why are they used?",
      ans: "Vendor prefixes are prefixes added to CSS property names to identify which browser vendor (e.g., -webkit- for WebKit-based browsers like Chrome and Safari) implemented the property.

    },

    {
      que: "What is the 'overflow' property in CSS and how is it used?",
      ans: "The 'overflow' property in CSS controls how content that exceeds the dimensions of an element's box is handled.

    },

    {
      que: "What is the purpose of the 'aspect-ratio' property in CSS?",
      ans: "The 'aspect-ratio' property in CSS allows you to specify the aspect ratio of an element's box, ensuring that it maintains a particular width-to-height ratio even as its size changes. It's useful for creating responsive designs with consistent aspect ratios for images, videos, or containers.",
