        "que": "How do you define a document's base URL in HTML?",
        "ans": "You define a document's base URL using the `<base>` tag inside the `<head>` section. The `href` attribute of the `<base>` tag specifies the base URL for all relative URLs in the document. Example: `<base href='https://www.example.com/'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `aria-live` attribute.",
        "ans": "The `aria-live` attribute indicates that an element will be updated and that those updates should be communicated to assistive technologies. It can have values like 'polite', 'assertive', or 'off', dictating how updates are announced to users."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `formaction` attribute in HTML?",
        "ans": "The `formaction` attribute specifies the URL to which the form data will be sent when the form is submitted. This attribute can be used on `<button>` or `<input type='submit'>` elements to override the form's `action` attribute."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a collapsible section in HTML?",
        "ans": "You create a collapsible section using the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements. The `<summary>` element provides a summary or label for the collapsible content, which is enclosed in the `<details>` element. Example: `<details><summary>More Info</summary><p>This is the collapsible content.</p></details>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `<bdi>` element in HTML?",
        "ans": "The `<bdi>` (Bi-Directional Isolation) element is used to isolate a span of text that might be formatted in a different direction than the surrounding text. It ensures that the text inside it does not interfere with the surrounding text direction."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `list` attribute in the `<input>` tag.",
        "ans": "The `list` attribute in the `<input>` tag is used to bind the input field to a `<datalist>` element, which provides a list of predefined options for the user to select from. This enhances user experience by offering suggestions while typing."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a responsive table in HTML?",
        "ans": "To create a responsive table, you can use CSS to make the table scrollable horizontally on smaller screens. This can be done by wrapping the `<table>` in a `<div>` with `overflow-x: auto;` and setting the table to `width: 100%;`. Alternatively, using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap can help achieve responsive tables more easily."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `contenteditable` attribute, and how is it used?",
        "ans": "The `contenteditable` attribute specifies whether the content of an element is editable by the user. When set to `true`, the user can modify the element's content directly in the browser. Example: `<div contenteditable='true'>This is editable text.</div>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the purpose of the `<output>` element in HTML.",
        "ans": "The `<output>` element is used to represent the result of a calculation or user action. It is commonly used in conjunction with JavaScript to display dynamic results based on user inputs or other interactions within a form."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a hidden form field in HTML?",
        "ans": "You create a hidden form field using the `<input>` tag with `type='hidden'`. This field is not visible to the user but its value is submitted with the form. It is useful for storing data that should be sent to the server but not shown to the user."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `spellcheck` attribute, and how is it used?",
        "ans": "The `spellcheck` attribute specifies whether the element's content should be checked for spelling errors. When set to `true`, the browser will highlight misspelled words and suggest corrections. This attribute can be used on text input fields and editable elements."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `<s>` tag in HTML.",
        "ans": "The `<s>` (strikethrough) tag is used to indicate text that is no longer accurate or relevant, often displayed with a strikethrough effect. It is commonly used to show edits, deletions, or changes in content."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create an accessible image link in HTML?",
        "ans": "To create an accessible image link, use an `<a>` tag with an `<img>` tag inside it and include appropriate `alt` text for the image. The `alt` text ensures that screen readers can describe the link's purpose. Example: `<a href='https://example.com'><img src='image.jpg' alt='Description of the link'></a>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `<small>` element in HTML?",
        "ans": "The `<small>` element is used to represent side comments, fine print, or less important text. It typically renders the text in a smaller font size, helping to differentiate it from the main content."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag?",
        "ans": "The `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag specifies the language of the document's content. This helps search engines and screen readers process the content correctly, improving accessibility and SEO. Example: `<html lang='en'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a form that allows users to upload files?",
        "ans": "To create a form that allows file uploads, use the `<input>` tag with `type='file'`. Ensure the form's `enctype` attribute is set to `multipart/form-data` to handle file data correctly. Example: `<form enctype='multipart/form-data'><input type='file' name='fileUpload'></form>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `novalidate` attribute in a form element?",
        "ans": "The `novalidate` attribute disables form validation when the form is submitted. It allows the form to be submitted even if there are invalid inputs. This can be useful for testing or specific use cases where validation is handled server-side."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `<map>` and `<area>` elements in HTML.",
        "ans": "The `<map>` element defines an image map, which is an image with clickable areas. The `<area>` elements within the `<map>` specify the coordinates and shapes of these clickable areas. The `usemap` attribute on the `<img>` tag links to the map. Example: `<img src='image.jpg' usemap='#mapname'><map name='mapname'><area shape='rect' coords='34,44,270,350' href='link.html'></map>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you use the `autocomplete` attribute in form elements?",
        "ans": "The `autocomplete` attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete enabled, allowing browsers to suggest previously entered values. It can be set to 'on' or 'off'. Example: `<input type='text' name='username' autocomplete='on'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `tabindex` attribute and how is it used?",
        "ans": "The `tabindex` attribute specifies the tab order of an element when the 'Tab' key is used for navigation. A positive value sets the element's position in the tab order, `0` includes the element in the natural tab order, and `-1` removes it from the tab order but makes it focusable via script. Example: `<input type='text' tabindex='1'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `<code>` and `<pre>` elements.",
        "ans": "The `<code>` element represents a fragment of computer code and is typically displayed in a monospace font. The `<pre>` element represents preformatted text, which preserves whitespace and line breaks, making it ideal for displaying code blocks. Example: `<pre><code>let x = 10;</code></pre>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `srcset` attribute in the `<img>` tag, and how does it work?",
        "ans": "The `srcset` attribute allows you to define a list of different image sources and their corresponding sizes. The browser selects the most appropriate image based on the device's screen size and resolution. Example: `<img srcset='image-small.jpg 500w, image-medium.jpg 1000w, image-large.jpg 1500w' src='image-large.jpg' alt='Responsive image'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a definition list in HTML?",

      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `placeholder` attribute in input elements.",
        "ans": "The `placeholder` attribute provides a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field. The placeholder text is displayed inside the input field when it is empty, guiding users on what to enter. Example: `<input type='text' placeholder='Enter your name'>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `srcdoc` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag?",
        "ans": "The `srcdoc` attribute specifies the HTML content to be displayed in the `<iframe>` directly within the element. It is an alternative to the `src` attribute and allows embedding HTML content without an external URL. Example: `<iframe srcdoc='<p>Embedded content</p>'></iframe>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a table with a caption in HTML?",

Example: `<table><caption>Monthly Sales Data</caption><tr><th>Month</th><th>Sales</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>$10,000</td></tr></table>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `aria-hidden` attribute in HTML.",
        "ans": "The `aria-hidden` attribute indicates whether an element and its children are perceivable to assistive technologies. Setting it to 'true' hides the element from screen readers, which can be useful for content that is visually hidden but still present in the DOM."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `<mark>` element?",
        "ans": "The `<mark>` element is used to highlight text that is relevant or important in the context of the document. It typically displays text with a yellow background, making it stand out from the surrounding content. Example: `<p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> word.</p>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you create a navigation menu using HTML5 elements?",
        "ans": "You create a navigation menu using the `<nav>` element, which represents a section of navigation links. Inside the `<nav>`, you can use an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) containing anchor tags (`<a>`) for each menu item. Example: `<nav><ul><li><a href='#home'>Home</a></li><li><a href='#about'>About</a></li><li><a href='#contact'>Contact</a></li></ul></nav>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the `ping` attribute in an `<a>` tag?",
        "ans": "The `ping` attribute specifies a space-separated list of URLs to be notified if the user follows the hyperlink. This can be used for tracking purposes.

      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the difference between the `<strong>` and `<b>` tags.",
        "ans": "The `<strong>` tag indicates that the enclosed text has strong importance or urgency, and is often displayed in bold. The `<b>` tag simply makes the text bold without implying any additional importance. Using `<strong>` is preferred for semantic HTML, while `<b>` is more for visual styling."
      },
      {
        "que": "How do you use the `download` attribute in an `<a>` tag?",
        "ans": "The `download` attribute in an `<a>` tag prompts the browser to download the linked resource rather than navigating to it. You can optionally specify a filename for the downloaded file. Example: `<a href='file.pdf' download='custom_name.pdf'>Download PDF</a>`."
      },
      {
        "que": "What is the purpose of the `<wbr>` element?",
        "ans": "The `<wbr>` (Word Break Opportunity) element represents a position within text where the browser can optionally break a line. It helps control word wrapping in long strings, improving the readability of text in narrow containers. Example: `super<wbr>califragilistic<wbr>expialidocious`."
      },
      {
        "que": "Explain the use of the `<abbr>` element in HTML.",
        "ans": "The `<abbr>` element is used to represent an abbreviation or acronym, providing an optional `title` attribute to specify the full expansion.
